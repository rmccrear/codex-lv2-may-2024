### Follow-Up Assignment: Managing Pet Energy and Happiness

#### Objective:
This assignment will reinforce your understanding of JavaScript loops and conditionals by having you manage the energy and happiness of pets through playing and feeding.

#### Instructions:

1. **Update Play Method:**
   - Modify the `play` method in your pet objects so that it:
     - Increases the pet's `happiness` by 10.
     - Decreases the pet's `energy` by 15.
     - Returns a message like, "You played with Fluffy! Happiness is now 60, Energy is now 85."

2. **Play with Pets:**
   - Before feeding, use a `for` loop to play with some pets more than others (e.g., play with the first pet three times, the second pet once, etc.).
   - Log the status of each pet after playing.

3. **Feed Pets Conditionally:**
   - Write a `for` loop to iterate through each kennel (dogs, cats, fish).
   - Inside the loop, check if the pet’s `energy` is below 30.
   - If it is, feed the pet using the `feed` method and log the updated status.

4. **Bonus Task (Optional):**
   - Instead of starting with 100 energy, initialize each pet’s `energy` with a random value between 0 and 50.
   - This will make the task more dynamic and simulate varying energy levels among pets.

5. **Test Your Code:**
   - Ensure that only pets with energy below 30 are fed after playing.
   - Display the status of each pet before and after feeding.

#### Submission:
Use git to commit and push your code. Your code for day 5 will be in the file `index-5.js`. Ensure your code is well-commented to explain what each part does.

#### Example Output:
```javascript
// Play with pets
kennel[0].play(); // Plays with the first pet
kennel[0].play(); // Plays with the first pet again
kennel[1].play(); // Plays with the second pet

// Status after playing
kennel.forEach(pet => pet.status()); 

// Conditional feeding
for (let i = 0; i < kennel.length; i++) {
    // TODO: only feed the hungry pets
}

// Status after feeding
kennel.forEach(pet => pet.status());
```

#### Evaluation Criteria (10 points):
- Correct implementation of the `play` method to manage both happiness and energy. (2 points)
- Effective use of the `for` loop to play with and then feed pets conditionally. (5 points)
- Properly logged status of each pet after playing and feeding. (1 points)
- Clear and concise comments explaining the code. Good indentation. (1 points)
- **Bonus:** Random initial energy values between 0 and 50 for each pet. (1 points)
