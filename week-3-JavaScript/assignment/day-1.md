# Learning about objects, methods and thisÂ in JavaScript 

## Objective

This assignment aims to enhance your understanding of JavaScript objects and methods by creating a simple pet object. You'll learn how to define properties, implement methods to interact with the object, and practice manipulating data within an object, reinforcing foundational object-oriented programming concepts.

## Instructions

### Assignment: Create Your Own Pet Object in JavaScript

#### Objective:
This assignment will help you understand and reinforce the concepts of objects and methods in JavaScript by creating a simple object representing a pet with properties and methods.

#### Setup:

Create a repo for this week called Pet-Kennel-Shell

Each day, you will make one file. The first day, you will make `index.js`, the second `index-2.js` and so on.

#### Instructions:

1. **Create a Pet Object:**
   - Open `index.js`
   - Create an object named `pet`.
   - Add the following properties to the `pet` object:
     - `name`: a string representing the pet's name.
     - `species`: a string representing the type of pet (e.g., "Dog", "Cat").
     - `happiness`: a number representing the pet's happiness level (start with 50).

2. **Add Methods:**
   - Add a method named `play` to the `pet` object. This method should increase the `happiness` property by 10 and return a message like, "You played with Fluffy! Happiness is now 60."
   - Add a method named `feed` to the `pet` object. This method should increase the `happiness` property by 20 and return a message like, "You fed Fluffy! Happiness is now 70."
   - Add a method named `status` to the `pet` object. This method should print out a message like, "Pet Name: Fluffy, Species: Dog, Happiness: 70."

3. **Implement and Test:**
   - Implement the `pet` object and its methods in your code.
   - Log the following to the console:
     1. The initial status of the pet using the `status` method.
     2. The message returned by the `play` method.
     3. The updated status after calling the `feed` method.

4. **Bonus Task (Optional):**
   - Add a method named `rename` to the `pet` object that accepts a parameter `newName`. This method should update the `name` property with the new value and return a message like, "Your pet's new name is Sparky!"
   - Test this method by renaming your pet and logging the new status using the `status` method.

#### Submission:
Use git to commit and push your code. Your code for day 1 will be in the file `index.js`. Ensure your code is well-commented to explain what each part does.

#### Example Output:
```javascript
pet.status(); // Output: Pet Name: Fluffy, Species: Dog, Happiness: 50
console.log(pet.play()); // Output: You played with Fluffy! Happiness is now 60.
pet.status(); // Output: Pet Name: Fluffy, Species: Dog, Happiness: 60
console.log(pet.feed()); // Output: You fed Fluffy! Happiness is now 80.
pet.status(); // Output: Pet Name: Fluffy, Species: Dog, Happiness: 80

// If you did the bonus task:
pet.rename('Sparky');
pet.status(); // Output: Pet Name: Sparky, Species: Dog, Happiness: 80
```

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of the `pet` object with all required properties and methods. (5 points)
- Proper use of JavaScript syntax and object-oriented principles. (5 points)
- Clear and concise comments explaining the code. (3 points)
- Successful completion of the bonus task (if attempted). (2 points)
- Note: Completing required tasks will result in 13/15 score (an "A"). Completing the bonus will result in 15/15 (an "A+"). This is because Moodle doesn't allow for extra "bonus" points on assignments.
