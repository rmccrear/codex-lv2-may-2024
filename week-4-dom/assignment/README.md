# JS, HTML, and the DOM

### Day 1

Create a sign-up form in HTML that captures a pet owner's details and stores them in a global JavaScript object called state. The form won't submit data but will log the state object to the console. This assignment reinforces HTML form handling and basic JavaScript object manipulation.

### Day 2

Create a `createPetOwner` factory function that generates a `petOwner` object with a `render` method to dynamically display details on a webpage when a button is clicked. Learning objectives include practicing JavaScript factory functions, methods, DOM manipulation, and event handling for dynamic web content updates.
