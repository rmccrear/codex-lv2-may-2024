# Process for capstone Week 1

The capstone project is your chance to put it all together and challenge yourself to build a complex piece of software. You will test your knowledge of factory functions, Dev Tools, Bootstrap, fetch, and async/await. But you will also test your ability to apply techniques like proof-of-life, debugging, and wireframing.

Remember. Review the requirements for the capstone project.

We will have two weeks to work on the capstone. In this first week we will also introduce industry standard techniques in git branching to help you "re-wind" code if you have bugs.
