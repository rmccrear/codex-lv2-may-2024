## Day 1

In this assignment, you'll create a dynamic webpage that interacts with the PokéAPI. You'll build a simple HTML form with a text input for the Pokémon's name or ID and a button to fetch the data. Using JavaScript, you'll make an API request to retrieve the Pokémon's details. The data will be processed using a factory function to create a Pokémon object. Finally, you'll display the Pokémon's information in a card format on the webpage by inserting the object into the DOM. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of APIs, factory functions, and DOM manipulation.

## Day 2

In this assignment, you'll create a webpage that fetches and displays Pokémon item names in multiple languages using the PokéAPI. You'll start by setting up an HTML form where users can input the name or ID of a Pokémon item. After retrieving the item data from the API, you'll extract and process the translations, sorting them alphabetically. The translations will be dynamically displayed in a list on the page when a button is clicked. Along the way, you'll use JavaScript to manage the fetch requests, handle arrays, and update the DOM. The assignment emphasizes API interaction, array processing, and dynamic content rendering.
